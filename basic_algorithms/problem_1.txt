The time complexity is O(logn) where n is the number of integers from 1 to the input integer number, n. I'm dividing the range in half for each iteration to find the answer. Therefore, the sqrt function would cost O(logn).

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using few variables to do calcualtions and not accumulating any data from the calculations.
