The time complexity of "sort_012" is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list. I'm going through each element in the input list and if the element is 0, I pop and insert the element in the beginning of the list. This pop and insert operation (prepend) would take O(1). If the element is 2, I pop and append the element at the end of the list. That would also cost O(1). Overall, the whole operation would cost O(n).

The space complexity would be O(1) since we are looking at and working on one element at a time. We are doing in-place sorting.
