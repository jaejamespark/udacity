The time complexity of "rearrange_digits" function is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list. I looked at each digits (or elements) in the input list and counted occurrence of each digit using a dictionary in O(n) time. The dictionary contains digits from 0-9 as keys and number of occurrence as values. I went through the dictionary from digit 9 to 0 and created the two arrays with rearranged elements. This operations took O(n) as well since I had to iterate as many time as the number of elements in the input.

The space complexity would be O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list because I need to store two output arrays that contain the same number of elements as the input list.
