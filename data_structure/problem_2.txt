This "find_files" functions finds files in the user supplied path and if any directory is found, it recursively calls itself with the new path of the directory. In the end, it returns a list of files that contains the suffix that user requested.

The time complexity of this function would be O(n+m) where n is the total number of files and m is the total number of directories under the path. This function has to look at all the files and directories under the path.

The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of found files.
