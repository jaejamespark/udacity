The group can contain many subgroups. To see if a user is in a group, we have to look at all users in the current group and all the subgroups.

The time complexity for this function would be O(n * m) where n is the number of users in each group and m is the number of groups. 

The space complexity would be O(n * m) where n is the number of users in each group and m is the number of groups. The memory stores n users for each m number of stacks in recursion. Therefore, the total memory required would be O(n * m).
